Facebook Full Profile Picture Viewer
e.g.
you want to see a profile picture of someone who isn't your friend
but all you have is this poor tiny 160 x 160 pic
!
hopefully this program is made for you !
just enter the url of the tiny pic and it will give you the link to the bigger one


Files:
 - this readme.
 - fbFPPViewer.py
	contain the code!


Keep in mind:
 - this probably won't work forever
 - I didn't test all the possibility (because I don't know them)
 - feedback is welcome
